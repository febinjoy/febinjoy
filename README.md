## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Technical Lead and Software Architect with 20+ years of experience designing secure, scalable distributed systems across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments. I specialise in enterprise platforms for highly regulated sectors such as mobility, healthcare, and critical operations.

At **Smartrak**, I lead technical strategy and engineering for large-scale platforms like **PoolCar** and **Keyless Entry**, serving 300+ organisations across ANZ—including law enforcement, universities, and hospitals. I translate business-critical challenges into resilient, modern architectures that deliver:

- ✅ 99.9% system uptime  
- 💸 30% infrastructure cost reduction  
- 🔐 100% compliance audit success  

**What I Bring:**
- 🔄 Legacy transformation (VB.NET → microservices)
- ☁️ Cloud migration (Azure, AWS)
- 🔐 Secure-by-design development (HIPAA, ISO 27001)
- 🚀 DevOps automation (CI/CD, infrastructure as code)
- 🤝 Technical leadership & mentoring across global teams

I architect solutions that solve real-world problems—securely, scalably, and strategically.
